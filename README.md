# Resources
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
  * I use this site, along with my notes, to refresh on javascript and jquery differences.

# Deductions
- I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
* I did not add any plugins, as it was already after the due time when I submitted and I was having a hard time getting any to work properly and did not want my project to be submitted even later.
* My custom java and jQuery code alert you when you click either submit or reset of your action and change the color of the h1's and h2's.
